# Furfsky Mini
[中文版](README.zh_CN.md) | English

A minimized version of Furfsky Reborn,  
with some good old textures replaced.
## Generation
This resource pack is generated by modifying the original Furfsky Reborn automatically.
Extract the original version (Overlay version) and remember the folder path (the folder containing `pack.mcmeta`).
Install Python and run:
```
# 1.8.9
python patch.py /path/to/original/pack
```
Replace `/path/to/original/pack` with the actual path.

## TBD
- Implementation for higher versions
- Clearer `patch.py` implementation.
